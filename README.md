# An-Atlas-of-Correlations-Across-Human-Diseases

Abstract: The domain of health awareness is gaining a tremendous focus. WebMD has been a major resource for publishing information pertaining to human health. It is a forum where people discuss about different health issues. In this project we focus on analyzing the discussion done in the forum and produce a visualization which helps correlate the different health issues with each other. The main goal is to display a network(map) which represents the similar issues in same cluster and connects a cluster with another cluster. We organize the networks based on different systems in our body thus forming an Atlas of correlated Human Diseases.
